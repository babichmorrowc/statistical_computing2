## What is HPC?

High performance computing (HPC) is the use of combined computational power of many individual computers via supercomputers or clusters. 

Prepare jobs on login node, submit jobs to compute notdes

BlueCrystal Phase 4 is recommended for most workloads
BluePebble is recommended for high throughput computing (a bit newer than BlueCrystal Phase 4)

Anything on the HPC is not backed up

Data storage:
+ home directory: fairly small
+ scratch space: 1 TB to store the data (not backed up)
+ RDSF for longer term storage
