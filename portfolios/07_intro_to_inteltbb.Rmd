# Introduction to Intel-TBB

Intel-TBB stands for Intel's Threading Building Blocks. It is now a part of something called oneAPI, which is a set of tools and libraries that Intel has developed to help you leverage the power of multi-core processors. Intel-TBB is a C++ template library for parallel programming. 


## OpenMP vs. Intel-TBB

Both are third-party tools that are not part of C++ itself. OpenMP is a set of compiler directives that you can use to tell the compiler to parallelize your code. Intel-TBB is a C++ template library that you can use to parallelize your code.

Intel-TBB uses standard C++ templates and classes, so it is more portable than OpenMP. 

# Using Intel-TBB

The following code compiles a C++ program using Intel-TBB. 

```{bash eval = FALSE}
g++ -O3 --std=c++14 test.cpp -Iinclude -ltbb -o test
```

Components of the command:

* `-O3` tells the compiler to optimize the code
* `--std=c++14` tells the compiler to use the C++14 standard (you can use other more recent versions if you want)
* `-Iinclude` tells the compiler to look for header files in the `include` directory
* `-ltbb` tells the compiler to link the Intel-TBB library

# Functional programming

Intel-TBB is based on functional programming, which is a programming paradigm that treats functions as objects. 
Functional programming works easily in R and Python since you can use functions as arguments of other functions natively. Things are a bit more complicated with C++ since C++ relies on variable types. The type of a variable tells you want you can do with that variable and what happens when you act on it. The code referring to a function is a type in C++ just like `int` or `double`, but the syntax gets complicated. For example, the type of a function that takes two `int` arguments and returns an `int` is `int (*)(int, int)`. Fortunately, we can use `auto` instead to avoid needing to write out the type of a function in that way.

## Functions as arguments

A template in C++ is a way to write a function or a class without specifying the type of the arguments or the class members. This is useful when you want to write a function or a class that can work with different types of arguments or class members. For example:

```{Rcpp eval=FALSE}
template<class FUNC, class ARG1, class ARG2>
auto call_function(FUNC func, ARG1 arg1, ARG2 arg2)
{
    auto result = func(arg1, arg2);
    return result;
}
```

In this example, `FUNC` is the type of the function, and `ARG1` and `ARG2` are the types of the arguments. The `auto` keyword tells the compiler to figure out the type of `result` based on the type of `func` and the types of `arg1` and `arg2`.

This means that you can pass function names to other functions. By changing the arguments to a function, you can completely change the function's behavior.

## Mapping functions

What if we don't want to write a new function for printing vectors for every type of vector? We can use a template to write a function that works with any type of vector. 

We want to move away from loops, which specify a given order for processing the code. By switching to mapping instead, we are allowing flexibility in the order, which will enable parallel processing.

## Reductions

A reduction takes a vector as an input and returns a single value, e.g. the sum of all the elements.

| **Output / Input** | 1         | N      |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----   |
| 1                  | function  | reduce |
| N                  | generator | map    |

## Lambda functions

Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a way to declare a function without needing to name it and assign it to a variable. They are useful when you want to pass a function as an argument to another function, but you aren't going to be reusing that function and it doesn't make sense to declare it separately. The syntax for lambda functions uses `[](){}`:

* Within `[]` 
* Within `()` you put the arguments of the function, specifying the types as usual
* Within `{}` you put the body of the function

For instance, the following are equivalent:

```{Rcpp eval=FALSE}
// traditional way to create function named name
auto name(arguments)
{
    expressions;
}

// unnamed function in lambda function
[](arguments){expressions;}
```
