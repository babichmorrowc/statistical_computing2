ALONSO
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

SEBASTIAN  He is drunk now. Where had he wine?

ALONSO
And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
[To Trinculo.] How cam'st thou in this pickle?

TRINCULO  I have been in such a pickle since I saw you
last that I fear me will never out of my bones. I
shall not fear flyblowing.

SEBASTIAN  Why, how now, Stephano?

STEPHANO  O, touch me not! I am not Stephano, but a
cramp.

PROSPERO  You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?

STEPHANO  I should have been a sore one, then.

ALONSO, [indicating Caliban]
This is as strange a thing as e'er I looked on.

PROSPERO
He is as disproportioned in his manners
As in his shape. [To Caliban.] Go, sirrah, to my cell.
Take with you your companions. As you look
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

CALIBAN
Ay, that I will, and I'll be wise hereafter
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
Was I to take this drunkard for a god,
And worship this dull fool!

PROSPERO  Go to, away!

ALONSO, [to Stephano and Trinculo]
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

SEBASTIAN  Or stole it, rather.
[Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo exit.]

PROSPERO
Sir, I invite your Highness and your train
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
For this one night, which part of it I'll waste
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
Go quick away: the story of my life
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this isle. And in the morn
I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized,
And thence retire me to my Milan, where
Every third thought shall be my grave.

ALONSO  I long
To hear the story of your life, which must
Take the ear strangely.

PROSPERO  I'll deliver all,
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
Your royal fleet far off. [Aside to Ariel.] My Ariel,
chick,
That is thy charge. Then to the elements
Be free, and fare thou well.--Please you, draw near.
[They all exit.]

EPILOGUE,
[spoken by Prospero.]
============================


Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
And what strength I have 's mine own,
Which is most faint. Now 'tis true
I must be here confined by you,
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
Since I have my dukedom got
And pardoned the deceiver, dwell
In this bare island by your spell,
But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands.
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill, or else my project fails,
Which was to please. Now I want
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
And my ending is despair,
Unless I be relieved by prayer,
Which pierces so that it assaults
Mercy itself, and frees all faults.
   As you from crimes would pardoned be,
   Let your indulgence set me free.
[He exits.]
