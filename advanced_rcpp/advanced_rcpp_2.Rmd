## Spreading Rcpp code over multiple files

Example of how to split into multiple files: 

1. File implementing the function you want to export to R: includes a header file
2. Header file: unless it has been defined before, define the function
3. File with definition of function called in the first file

Using `sourceCpp` will take care of all the compiler flags and such for you

## Using Rcpp in an R package

`Rcpp.package.skeleton("mypackage")` will create a new R package with Rcpp support
Includes a `src` folder with some C++ files
Functions need to be registered for CRAN
`Rcpp` wrapper for function automatically generated
Can write your roxygen comments in the Rcpp file and it will be automatically transferred to the R file
